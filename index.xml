&lt;p&gt;This blog is a humble attempt to document the process of translating the ideas and inspiration drawn from the book &lt;a href="https://a.co/d/6JxcwfI"&gt;Deep work&lt;/a&gt; into my real working environment as a software engineer.
Since I&amp;rsquo;m now at a point where I come back to work after a short period of leave. I used some of the time to reflect and came with a resolution to be even more intentional and focused on working with a deep work mindset. Trying to achieve the best results by working focused during my workday and resting and spending time with my family during the resting hours. (A.K.A - work life balance)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
