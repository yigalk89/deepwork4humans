## What is Deepwork4humans?
This blog is a humble attempt to document the process of translating the ideas and inspiration drawn from the book [Deep work](https://a.co/d/6JxcwfI) into my real working environment as a software engineer. 
Since I'm now at a point where I come back to work after a short period of leave. I used some of the time to reflect and came with a resolution to be even more intentional and focused on working with a deep work mindset. Trying to achieve the best results by working focused during my workday and resting and spending time with my family during the resting hours. (A.K.A - work life balance)

The following post I intend to write are going to be attempts to distill from the book practical methods I plan on following during my working days, with my comments on why I think it might work from my experience.
Another type of posts I hope would be part of this blog are reports on how it worked, what was the impact of following this path and ideas around deep and focused work.
