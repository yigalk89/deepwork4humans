# Intro
Next week would be my first working week after 4 months of parental leave. And I plan to take advantage of having a fresh start but in a familiar place - so since I'm already pretty well versed in my team's fundamental processes and systems, I intend to try to allocate some of me energy to adopt a new work routine. This is heavily inspired by the book [`deep work` by Cal Newport](https://a.co/d/1dIy4YQ) with my own attempt to adapt it to what make sense for me at work.  
# Equipment I intend to use
- A simple lined notepad - for the daily time blocks allocation.
- Sticky notes - an offline place to keep a commitment to the distraction-free block. Or when the next "distractions" are "allowed"
- A pen or pencil - to write on the previous objects.
- TBD - A way to track the amount of deep work time accumulated so far so we can celebrate. The inspiration is in Cal Newport's blog  [here](https://calnewport.com/lab-notes-i-spent-42-hours-last-month-on-the-activity-most-critical-to-my-success/) and [here](https://calnewport.com/from-deep-tallies-to-deep-schedules-a-recent-change-to-my-deep-work-habits/). I'll come back with the solution that worked for me when I review this how this routine worked in practice along the way.
# Working day beginning ritual A.K.A morning
## Allocating time blocks 
The purpose of this exercise is to be intentional with the time you plan to spend today. Not to be a plan to which you should stick at any cost.  
Using the lined notepad mentioned above, note every second line with an hour in your workday span. Every line would represent half an hour, the minimal time block. Consider meeting you have in your calendar, open tasks deep or shallow you have from yesterday's daily summary, and new initiatives you are trying to kick off. Allocate some time also for lunch / breaks during the day. I lean towards scheduling the first 30 minutes block for emails & slack recap, daily summary recap and the scheduling process.
**In case the plan doesn't go as expected it's totally OK** . We will improve with it as time goes, just **reallocate the reminder of the day so you have a vision on how to spend the rest of your working day.**
Generally speaking try to allocate as much deep work time as you can during the day. 
## Schedule next communications pause
On the sticky note write when would be the next break where you open your email, and slack to see if anything urgent pops. Also you should consider when would you check your phone next for messages from family and friends. My intuition is to schedule this every hour. Both for work related and private communications. I might as well experiment with separating the cycles in the future. Every time the cycle restarts - write when the next one is due so you have a good written commitment to remind you not to slide into a distracting spiral
