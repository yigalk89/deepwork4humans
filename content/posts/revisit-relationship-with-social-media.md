I spend on social media way more time than I want to. These tools are addictive, and mainly optimize to grab our attention and show us relevant adds. However, not everything is negative in these tools. One can learn new things on Facebook, or reconnect with friends and family members which they don't get to interact with on a daily basis. The question is, are this benefits enough to justify the usage of those tools? 
# Quiet quitting social media for 30 days
Facebook, instagram, tellegram? youtube? Whatsapp is more communication and has no feed. Maybe a feed is the threshold? LinkedIn?
## After the 30 days - review how it went
Would this 30 days feel better if I were using the social media tools I stoped?
# Scheduled phone and internet time 
- Coming back turning off phone and leave in backpack. Be present with children
- After children sleep, schedule time to answer messages / interact with the world / internet for positive things / read instead of scrolling

# Support concentration
These tactics are intended to support fulfillment in life and also our concentration / our ability to deploy deep work.

# Next steps
Watch [Cal's great talk about quitting social media]() and I'll report how it went, am I keeping the experiment for longer? Or it was just plain suffer?
