And I plan to take advantage of having a fresh start but in a familiar place - so since I&amp;rsquo;m already pretty well versed in my team&amp;rsquo;s fundamental processes and systems, I intend to try to allocate some of my energy to adopt a new work routine. This is heavily inspired by the book &lt;a href="https://a.co/d/1dIy4YQ"&gt;&lt;code&gt;deep work&lt;/code&gt; by Cal Newport&lt;/a&gt; with my own attempt to adapt it to what makes sense for me at work.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>About - V0</title><link>https://deepwork4humans.com/posts/about-v0/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 10:35:40 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://deepwork4humans.com/posts/about-v0/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="what-is-deepwork4humans"&gt;What is Deepwork4humans?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog is a humble attempt to document the process of translating the ideas and inspiration drawn from the book &lt;a href="https://a.co/d/6JxcwfI"&gt;Deep work&lt;/a&gt; into my real working environment as a software engineer.
Since I&amp;rsquo;m now at a point where I come back to work after a short period of leave. I used some of the time to reflect and came with a resolution to be even more intentional and focused on working with a deep work mindset. Trying to achieve the best results by working focused during my workday and resting and spending time with my family during the resting hours. (A.K.A - work life balance)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
