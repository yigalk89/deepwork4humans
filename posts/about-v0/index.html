This blog is a humble attempt to document the process of translating the ideas and inspiration drawn from the book Deep work into my real working environment as a software engineer.
Since I&rsquo;m now at a point where I come back to work after a short period of leave. I used some of the time to reflect and came with a resolution to be even more intentional and focused on working with a deep work mindset. Trying to achieve the best results by working focused during my workday and resting and spending time with my family during the resting hours.

Another type of posts I hope would be part of this blog are reports on how it worked, what was the impact of following this path and ideas around deep and focused work.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3 no-underline" href=https://deepwork4humans.com/>&copy; Deepwork4humans 2026</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
